[EDUCATIONAL NOTE]:
This dataset maps English words to the "Circumplex Model of Affect", 
a psychological framework developed by James Russell.

Each word acts as a key to a coordinate pair (Tuple):
    "word": (Valence, Activity)

1. Valence (X-Axis): Represents the POSITIVITY of the emotion.
   - Range: -1.0 (Very Negative) to +1.0 (Very Positive).
   
2. Activity (Y-Axis): Represents the ENERGY level of the emotion.
   - Range: -1.0 (Low Energy/Passive) to +1.0 (High Energy/Active).

[DISCLAIMER]:
The specific values below were generated by AI(Grok Expert) to 
approximate human nuance. They are NOT absolute truths. 
Language is subjective, what feels like "0.8" intensity to one person might 
feel like "0.5" to another.

THINK ABOUT BIAS:
- How would a biased person, or someone in a different state of mind, change these values?
- Imagine how someone experiencing deep depression might rank the 'Activity' of "happy."
- Imagine how someone with compromised morals might rank the 'Valence' of "revenge" or "cruelty."

This mapping is a rudimentary example of how the people in charge of AI 
(Engineers and Researchers) can 'bake' their own perspectives into a model's 
behavior. When we 'align' an AI to avoid certain topics, we are using 
values decided by humans who may be influenced by their own culture, state of 
mind, or personal ethics.

Students are encouraged to modify these values to see how it changes 
the position of the bubbles on the compass.
